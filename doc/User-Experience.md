# 2048 Open Fun Game - User experience

We are launching 2048 Open Fun Game,
and it shows us the last game we played.
Suppose we want to start a new one. We press "Try again" button and play the usual way.

But if you want to use some artificial intelligence (AI), we can press that "Magic" button, - and it shows us the suggested move and some tips on the expected score and number of moves it could make. Five seconds it took for AI for the next move, 

Now I will switch to the most effective algorithm: "Longest random play"...

Oh, it works fast and shows us, what we should do. At any time we can switch AI off by pressing "Magic" button at the top, and it won't show us any new move tips anymore.

Suppose we want to remember, to bookmark some position in our game e.g. before making some important decision about a move, and we think that we may need to return to the same place and try to go another way, make some other move here.
We press "Bookmark" button, see that its icon is filled, so the bookmark is set.
And we continue playing, knowing that it will be easy for us to return to this place later.

How do we do this? - We press "Menu" button at the top right, "Go to bookmark" -
and we see that the top one line in the list is our current game position, 
and just below it - the bookmark that we have set: score ... move ... 
We tap that line and see our game at the bookmarked place.
But now we are in the "Watch" mode: see the changed button at the top left.

In the Watch mode we can go backwards or forward at any speed that we need. The game doesn't change in this mode. Increase speed by additional swipes left (for going backwards) or right.
This is just replaying of our game.

At any time we can decide that we want to start playing from that position. It could be any position: bookmarked or not.
We switch to the "Play" mode by tapping "Watch mode" button at the top left. And start making moves!

Or we can decide that further we want AI to continue playing, and we want to see how Artificial Intelligence does this. 
We turn AI on by pressing "Magic" button. It shows us, what to do. 
Now we press "Magic play" button, and it starts making moves automatically at quite slow speed.
We could make showing faster: we see that it takes less than a second for AI to choose the next move. Sometimes more, sometimes less - depending on the position.
If we swipe to the right, we increase speed. More and more...
We increase speed of showing, but we cannot make AI think faster. 
This is why sometimes we don't see speed increase. The algorithm continues playing...

Now we can switch back to our manual mode by a swipe down or by tapping "Stop" button. We can play manually now, as we always do.

I didn't show you yet that we can open any recent game, for example the game which was very interesting. 
Quite a long game. We are in the "Watch" mode and can navigate its moves backwards or forward. After the sixth speed we can press "To the start" (or "To the end") button and see the game from its beginning.
Now I'm pressing Stop or Swipe down.

I can share the game via any app that can send a text file, e.g. via email. Pressing "Menu" button and then - "Share game". Later we can load this text file using "Load game" menu item at any other device, or at this device thus creating a copy of the existing game.

Share and send via email. This is it! In order to send to myself I don't even need to "Send" it - the draft is saved anyway. 

And now I return to the game... Now we can, for example, switch from current Dark theme to the Light theme. Menu -> Switch theme.

I can "Try again" and play in the Light theme now. We see, how long we play,
see number of moves on the right side of the "Score bar", current score and best score - to the left. 

We can, of course, undo the game moves any number of times to any depth, and redo if necessary. At the position, which we like, we can continue playing rewriting previous game history.

This is basically it.

Thanks for watching and see you as happy players having fun!
