## Information collection

2048 Open Fun Game app stores on the Android device in the internal memory of the app recent Game Records. 
Each Game Record contains:
* Date and time, when the game started.
* All moves during the game. Including moves by a Computer and by a User.
* Final game board: placements of blocks on the board, current score, 
  date and time of the last change, total time played (excluding pauses).
* Bookmarks: Each bookmark contains the same info as the "Final game board".  

A User can see a list of stored Game Records and delete them one by one.

## Information sharing

The app allows a User to Share any Game Record, selected by the User. 
The Game Record is shared using Android built-in Share feature. Data is shared as plain text (for short games)
 or as a text (JSON) file (for games with about 100 moves or more). The data can be shared to any app, 
 installed on the User's device, that supports such text or file sharing.
 
The app allows to load (into its list of recent games) previously shared Game Record.
